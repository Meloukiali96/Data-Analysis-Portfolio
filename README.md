# 📊 Data Analysis Portfolio  

Welcome! This repository is part of my **data analysis portfolio**, where I apply analytical techniques to topics I’m genuinely interested in.  
I believe the best way to grow as a data analyst is to **work on real-world questions** that spark curiosity.  

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here
Each project includes:  
- A **dataset** (collected or cleaned from public sources)  
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualizations** created with Matplotlib/Seaborn or Power BI  
- A **story-driven blog-style writeup** published via GitHub Pages  

## 🎯 Goals of This Portfolio
- Show my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data  
- Demonstrate **data storytelling**: turning raw numbers into insights  
- Practice with tools used in real-world analytics:  
  - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
  - SQL  
  - Power BI / Jupyter Notebook  
  - GitHub Pages for publishing  

## 🧑‍💻 My Approach
I choose projects based on things I enjoy—like games, economics, or trends—because that keeps me motivated while also proving that **data analysis can answer almost any question**.
