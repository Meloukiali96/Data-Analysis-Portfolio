# RPG Mechanics Analysis – What Makes a Hit?

![Cover](/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/assets/image1.png)

**Insights from over 70 best-selling RPGs of all time**

Designing a successful RPG isn’t just about story or graphics—it’s about the mechanics that keep players engaged. Combat style, party management, crafting systems, exploration, and even romance options all shape a game’s commercial and critical performance.

🎯 **Purpose:** This analysis aims to guide studios (and showcase my data storytelling skills) by identifying the RPG mechanics most correlated with sales success and critical acclaim.

## 🚀 Key Insights

### 1. Combat Systems
- **Hybrid combat** (mix of action + tactical elements) leads the pack, averaging **$20M per title**.
- **Pure action** systems follow closely at ~$19M.
- **Turn-based** combat lags in sales (~$7M) but retains the strongest *critical reception*.

📌 *Interpretation:* Turn-based RPGs are niche but beloved. Hybrids appeal to a broader mainstream audience.

---

### 2. Party Control
- **Single-protagonist** RPGs nearly **double the sales** of full party-based systems.
- Games with **AI companions** rank in the middle, appealing to casual players.

📌 *Interpretation:* Focused character design and narrative are commercially safer, though party-based systems remain a staple for hardcore fans.

### 3. Narrative & Choices
- Games with **branching dialogue / choice-lite** systems average ~$17–20M.
- **Fully linear stories** trail behind at ~$6–11M.

📌 *Interpretation:* Players want agency, even if limited. “Illusion of choice” is often enough to boost engagement and sales.

### 4. Romance & Relationships
- Titles that include **romance mechanics** average **$15M**, versus **$12M** without.

📌 *Interpretation:* Relationship-building adds emotional depth and replayability, which pays off commercially.

### 5. Crafting & Equipment
- **Advanced crafting systems** more than **double sales** ($18M vs $8M).

📌 *Interpretation:* Deep crafting = player investment. Shallow equipment systems are a missed opportunity.

### 6. Exploration & World Design
- **Zone-based, interconnected open worlds**: ~$16–18M revenue.
- **Hub-based / overworld map** styles: ~$6–10M.

📌 *Interpretation:* Open-world exploration is now the expectation. Players reward games with immersive, explorable environments.

---

### 7. Multiplayer & Online Features
- **Co-op online RPGs** average ~$16M, slightly higher than MMOs (~$15M).
- **Pure single-player**: ~$11M.

📌 *Interpretation:* Social play drives longevity and revenue, but single-player still thrives with strong storytelling.

---

### 8. Critics vs Sales
- Critic scores strongly correlate with **long-term** sales.
- High-scoring niche titles (e.g., turn-based RPGs) may outsell flashier but poorly reviewed games *over time*.

📌 *Interpretation:* Critical acclaim extends a game’s sales tail.

## 🎯 Recommendations for Developers
1. **Combat:** Favor hybrid or action systems for mainstream appeal.  
2. **Exploration:** Build open, interconnected worlds.  
3. **Progression:** Deepen crafting/equipment to retain engagement.  
4. **Narrative:** Include at least “choice-lite” dialogue systems.  
5. **Player Engagement:** Optional romance + co-op multiplayer = higher replayability.  
6. **Critics vs Sales:** Don’t neglect narrative depth—critical praise drives long-term revenue.
